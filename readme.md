# TYPESCRIPT LIGHTWEIGHT EASY TO UNDERSTAND DEMO

This demo intents to show how to use typescript to EcmaScript 5 compilation, modules, and requireJS.

## HOW TO START IT

* Check that http-server is installed, otherwise use: npm install -g http-server
* Start web server, with no cache option: http-server ./ -c-1
* Access http://localhost:8080

## A FEW WORDS

* Source Typescript files are in the ts directory
* tsconfig.json describes how and where they should be compiled
* requireJS (amd in tsconfig.json) is eventually used to load modules
